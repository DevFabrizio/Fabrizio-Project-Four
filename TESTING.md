| HTML                |      | yes  | After correction of some minor mistakes all the errors attributed to the various templates are due to the use of the django template language                                                                                                                          |
| JavaScript          | Yes  |      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Python              |      | Yes  | The error only error is located in the settings.py file. This is due to a value being too long.  When the value is reformatted to fit the pyhton linter standards it interrupts the Heroku build process for deployment. Hence my decision to maintain it as an error. |
