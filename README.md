### Introduction

This README file is the collection and description of the features, decisions and funcionalities that are comprised in this project. It is divided into sections and sub-sections for easy reading. This file will cover everything from the inception of the project idea to the final steps of deployement and future features to be included.

## User Experience
### Strategy Plane

This project involves one of the most classic type of sofware/websites in today's market, a restaurant website. In particular this website is a mock website that includes many funcionalities. The idea behind this product is to create a platform for a high-end restaurant in a somewhat remote location. In addition to that the restaurant depicted has two main features: the use of seasonal and local supply and the development and employment of local personnel. Both of these decisions have been taken to highlight the underlying issue of "restoration of the native environment". This concept is based on the idea that the local supply of seasonal produce is the key to reduce the carbon footprint due to extensive farming and the cost and emissions of the logistics chain implied in the usual restaurant setting that we're all used to. Overall the Strategy was to create a platform that would invite users and then customers to the restaurant and also give them the possibility to discover the local cuisine rivisited using modern techniques and futuristic recipes. All in a environment conscious setting.

## Scope Plane

In order to obtain the result wanted for this product it was imperative that the deleopment process followed an Agile approach. Mostly because an Agile methodology would have allowed me to be more flexible with my schedule and with the objectives and features I wanted to develop. What I wanted to do with this website is to add enough features so that the users would be able to have an account on the webiste which would in return allow them to browse through all the reservations that they had made in the past. Based on previous experience and a small research conducted within the circle of people close to me I decided that another feature to add was the possibility of booking a table even WITHOUT having a profile on the website. This is because it has been found during the research that the majority of people usually don't dine at the same restaurant, even within the span of a couple of months. Hence the decision on having an unrestricted access to the reservations system even for random users. Some other necessary features born of the research on multiple other hogh end restaurants are a reference to the position of the location through the use of a map in a dedicated area of the website and a main page with detailed information on some key aspects of the restaurant like the menu, the main goal of the enterprise and and the chef leading the kitchen. 

## Structure Plane 

As a restaurant platform the development process for the structure was based on the possibility of letting the user decide to access all the content as a subscribed user of the website or as a simple visitor. The navigation through the various pages is guaranteed by the many links present. Most of these links are placed in the navigation bar at the top of the page as to always allow a quick method to move through the functionalities. In the pages dedicated to the users' reservations the link added to access the "delete" and "update" functionalities are only accessible on that specific page as it would have been a poor user experience in my opinion to place them anywhere else. The footer constitutes an evergreen in terms of social engagement for a restaurant website. Through the links in the footer section it is possible to access the major social media platforms in order to let the user stay up to date with the latest news from the restaurant without having to rely to the classic and somewhat invasive newsletter. 

### Goal

The main objective for this project was to create a restaurant website that would serve as a platform for the potential customer to explore the story and the main offer of the kitchen. In addition to that I also felt that it would be profitable to highlight the history and culinary education of the lead chef in the kitchen. As additional features this project also offers the possibility of booking a table at the restaurant both as a website member and as a simple first time visitor. All the users registered to the website have also the chance to update or delete reservation made.
