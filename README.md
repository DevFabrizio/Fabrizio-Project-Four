### Introduction

This README file is the collection and description of the features, decisions and functionalities that are comprised in this project. It is divided into sections and sub-sections for easy reading. This file will cover everything from the inception of the project idea to the final steps of deployement and future features to be included.

## User Experience
### Strategy Plane

This project involves one of the most classic type of software/websites in today's market, a restaurant website. In particular this website is a represantation of a product that includes many functionalities not always included in these types of pages. The idea behind this product is to create a platform for a high-end restaurant in a somewhat remote location. In addition to that the restaurant depicted has two main features: the use of seasonal and local supply and the development and employment of local personnel. Both of these decisions have been taken to highlight the underlying issue of "restoration of the native environment". This concept is based on the idea that the local supply of seasonal produce is the key to reduce the carbon footprint due to extensive farming and the cost and emissions of the logistics chain implied in the usual restaurant setting that we're all used to. Overall the Strategy was to create a platform that would invite users and then customers to the restaurant and also give them the possibility to discover the local cuisine rivisited using modern techniques and futuristic recipes. All in a environment conscious setting.

## Scope Plane

In order to obtain the result wanted for this product it was imperative that the development process followed an Agile approach. Mostly because an Agile methodology would have allowed me to be more flexible with my schedule and with the objectives and features I wanted to develop. What I wanted to do with this website is to add enough features so that the users would be able to have an account on the webiste which would in return allow them to browse through all the reservations that they had made in the past. Based on previous experience and a small research conducted within the circle of people close to me I decided that another feature to add was the possibility of booking a table even WITHOUT having a profile on the website. This is because it has been found during the research that the majority of people usually don't dine at the same restaurant, even within the span of a couple of months. Hence the decision on having an unrestricted access to the reservations system even for random users. Some other necessary features born of the research on multiple other high end restaurants are a reference to the position of the location through the use of a map in a dedicated area of the website and a main page with detailed information on some key aspects of the restaurant like the menu, the main goal of the enterprise and and the chef leading the kitchen. 

## Structure Plane 

As a restaurant platform the development process for the structure was based on the possibility of letting the user decide to access all the content as a subscribed user of the website or as a simple visitor. The information on the website is mostly text based and the navigation for the functionalities is guaranteed by various links. The main function of the structure is to eventually redirect the user to the booking page, whether it be for the users or for the occasional guest. Once on the booking system the user is prompted to fill out the required data in the form necessary for the submission. Once the information is sent, the back-end takes care of the reservation storing it in the appropriate database. 

## Skeleton Plane

This plane is the one that most of all has been influenced by the standard practices of the conteporary environment. The navigation through the various pages is guaranteed by the many links present. Most of these links are placed in the navigation bar at the top of the page as to always allow a quick method to move through the functionalities. In the pages dedicated to the users' reservations the link added to access the "delete" and "update" functionalities are only accessible on that specific page as it would have been a poor user experience in my opinion to place them anywhere else. The footer constitutes an evergreen in terms of social engagement for a restaurant website. Through the links in the footer section it is possible to access the major social media platforms in order to let the user stay up to date with the latest news from the restaurant without having to rely to the classic and somewhat invasive newsletter. 

## Surface Plane 

The work on this particular plane had something different compared to all the others. For this plane I decided to explore other Michelin starred restaurants' websites. I did this in order to get a better grasp of what a high end restaurant website looked like. What I discovered is that mainly these pages rely on simplicity and minimalism which I believe is somewhat linked to today's concept of modern cuisine. It is worthy of notice that many of these restaurants don't actually have a proprietary booking system and mainly rely on third parties' apps or simple email. This initial research has led me to develop a similar styling solution. In the website there are big images in the landing page, accompanied by some small, abstract text. I did this in order to create curiosity in the user and push them to investigate the website further. The pages dedicated to the reservation system are intentionally kept simple since I want to let the user only focus on completing the reservation succesfully.

### Fonts and Colors

The colors used for the website were decided on a base of simplicity and effectiveness. This comes from a brief analysis of other websites with similar goals to mine. For these type of pages what is majorly highlighted is the redability and contrast of the various components. The colors chosen are sometimes mostly white. Especially when the restaurant has a classical style and wishes to convey that old-time high end style. In case of more modern and future oriented pages it is not unusual to find the use of black or dark backgrounds with bright text. In case of this particular project I felt the need to emphasize the concept of "local" and "naturally sourced" which is one of the major premises of the restaurant. This led me to prevalently use a combination of light colors and a classic black text.

The fonts I decided to apply to this project are: Cinzel for the main headers and Montserrat for the descritpive text. Prior to this decision a quick read throught he typography documentation on Google Fonts was necessary. The main lesson learned is that as a basic rule, it would be ideal to use no more than 3 different fonts and to pair fonts from a Header/Supporting Text point of view. As a general rule I also decided to apply the rule of pairing fonts that would not contrast but compliment each other. This is usually done by matching Serif and Sans-serif fonts but any combination can work if the fonts are of the same family or don't presernt features that are opposite of each other.


## Project Goal

The main objective for this project was to create a restaurant website that would serve as a platform for the potential customer to explore the story and the main offer of the kitchen. In addition to that I also felt that it would be profitable to highlight the history and culinary education of the lead chef in the kitchen. As additional features this project also offers the possibility of booking a table at the restaurant both as a website member and as a simple first time visitor. All the users registered to the website have also the chance to update or delete reservations made. 

### Target Audience

Clearly a restaurant as physical entity barely poses a limit when it comes to admittance. That being said, we must consider which type of customer a high end restaurant could attract. Usually these types of dining experiences are structured as to subtly invite a more sophisticated customer base. The typical Michelin starred restaurant customer reserves a table knowing full well that they are preparing for a service and tasting event out of the ordinary. The cost factor is almost always present but it shouldn't necesseraliy constitute an entry barrier as there are many excellent kitchens around the world with prices that most if not all can afford. Given this initial information we need to take a step back and analize our customer base when it comes to traffic to the website. In this case the website doesn't initially filter any particular type of potential customer because everyone that can afford an internet connection can visit the website. The audience filtering will only begin once the guest will browse the website and most importantly the filtering will be passive as there are no pay-walls or subscription for the services provided by this project. Essentially the customer once they realize which type of offer this restaurant provides, are going to decide if they want to book a table or leave the page. Compared to other types of web pages, this method surely doesn't have the best ROI (Return on Investements) in terms of traffic, but no high-end restaurant would make that a strategy.

## User Story

The following is a brief list of the actions a potential user might want to make once they visit this website:

#### As a User I want to:

- Land on a page which will contain the website core content and a meaningful way to navigate through the pages.
- Access a menu section where I can get a general idea of what kind of menu options to expect.
- Read about the restaurant and its features
- Reserve a table without having to subscribe to a newsletter or other services
- Being able to subscribe to the website in order to have an account that allows me to access all my past and future reservations
- Being able to make new reservations as a subscribed user
- Being able to modify and/or delete reservations I made
- Being able to log out and log back in the website without any particular obstacle

## Interactions and Features

### Features Included

This is a brief description of the features included in the website:

- ![The large screen size nav bar](https://res.cloudinary.com/devfabrizio/image/upload/v1691044310/Project%20Matinicus/large-nav-bar_hzllih.png)
- ![The small screen size nav bar with the sandwich toggle for the menu](https://res.cloudinary.com/devfabrizio/image/upload/v1691044362/Project%20Matinicus/small-nav-bar_r3abqz.png)
    - This nav bar has been created using a Bootstrap element. It displays the navigation links on the left, which tranforms and regroup into a sandwich style navigation once the size of the device screen becomes small enough to allow the style to kick in. The header text on the left also serves as a link to redirect to the main page once clicked. In addition to that if a user registers on the website the name which they used will be shown on the navbar too. This allows the user to identify the logged in status. 

- ![The first section of the main page](https://res.cloudinary.com/devfabrizio/image/upload/v1691044345/Project%20Matinicus/menu-first-section_pffmty.png)
    - The first hero image and subsequent section content is all about a general presentation of the restaurant. This brief chunk of text is dedicated to explaining in a short but engaging manner the core values of the restaurant. The image and text chosen was designed to not bore the user and to increase the likelyhood of further investigation on the web page. 

- ![The second section of the main page](https://res.cloudinary.com/devfabrizio/image/upload/v1691044343/Project%20Matinicus/menu-second-section_llax4u.png)
- ![The examples from the menu](https://res.cloudinary.com/devfabrizio/image/upload/v1691044343/Project%20Matinicus/menu-recipes_jr4xsw.png)
    - The second section on the main page is for a classic example of the menu. Now, when it comes to the menu of high end restaurant it us usually a good idea to display a few recipe but never the entire menu or the prices. As previoulsy discussed, the clientele of this type of restaurant already knows that the cost is going to be above average. The examples of the menu are there to testify how the kitchen ideally process the thought of a new dish and how it comes to fruition for the customer.

- ![The last section from the main page](https://res.cloudinary.com/devfabrizio/image/upload/v1691044343/Project%20Matinicus/menu-third-section_bpwqtp.png)
    - The last section of the main page is dedicated to some background information about the lead chef. The chef is obviously the main professional figure in every restaurant, but even more so in high end ones. In this case I wanted to reiterate the concept of rediscovery of the island and its native supply of excellent material for new and exciting recipes. An accompanying picture creates a sense of "fame" around the chef as a person and will surely intrigue the customer who will look for him once seated.

- ![The maps page](https://res.cloudinary.com/devfabrizio/image/upload/v1691044312/Project%20Matinicus/maps-page_quduic.png)
    - The GPS icon located in the footer leads to this maps page. This page was designed as a little add-on in order to spark curiosity for the user. The page features a main section with an iframe element that contains an embedded Google map taken directly from the Google Maps website. The main goal for this page is to display a map where the user is able to pinpoint the location of the Matinicus island. This is to highlight not only the position of the restaurant but to remind any potential customer of how the location can play a huge part in what the offer and the peculiar type of recipes may be served in the restaurant. 

- ![The booking page](https://res.cloudinary.com/devfabrizio/image/upload/v1691044310/Project%20Matinicus/booking-page_f6pwzq.png)
    - This shown in the image is the detail of the Booking page for the anonymous users of the page. Style and format are designed to maintain simplicity and let the user make the reservations without distractions like messages of discounts or particular offers. I felt it was uneccessary to add other elements of style since the goal of this section is simply to take and check the validity of the reservation. This page also works as a blueprint for the users' reservations page as well. Basically both pages achieve the same result but for different type of users os the website. 

- ![The signup form](https://res.cloudinary.com/devfabrizio/image/upload/v1691044362/Project%20Matinicus/signup-page_j6rcla.png)
    - Shown above is the form to sign up to the website. Style, fonts and colors match those of the other pages of the project. Maintaining these features allow the user to gain a sense of familiarity which could also potentially lead to marginal gains on customer retention. Similar to this page the Log-in and Log-out pages are also styled accordingly. These features are at the base for future features implemented as described in the corresponding section. 
    
- ![The user reservations page](https://res.cloudinary.com/devfabrizio/image/upload/v1691044363/Project%20Matinicus/user-reservations-page_djchng.png)
    - This is the user reservation page. As one of the most meaningful features on the website I decided to place direct access to it on the nav-bar. This page accomplishes a very important role which is basically 75% of the CRUD functionalities. Particularly this page shows all the reservations made by a logged in user. Every reservation is displayed as a card and has two buttons on the bottom to access the EDIT and DELETE functions. Once redirected to any of those links the user will prompt the changes and submit them. It's important to note some details about this feature. This page is only available to user who have registered an account on the website. In addition to this the admin has access to all the reservations made. This allows the admin to manage the entirety of the reservations made. 


### Future Features

Although the website fullfills the tasks required by a normal restaurant website there are some features and functionalities that could be included as add-ons, in particular:
- Adding a system that would send discounts to registered users
- Adding a Twitch live-stream of the kitchen (this is the reason behind the Twitch link in the footer)
- Adding a personalized and effectie newsletter service that would distinguish itself from all the other newsletter services

### Bugs

During the development of this project I encoutered some bugs that I was able to fix, mainly through the use of support from the slack community but also by reading the Django Framework documentation and by some research on Google. Here is a list of the bugs and what I did to solve them. 

- The first main bug was a functionality I wanted to add that would have allowed the admin to manage all the reservations from the website instead of having to accomplish that on the django admin page. The main difficulty was that when I tried to access a reservation made from an anonymous user or from a logged in user the View would return an error because it was trying to access the view by using the admin credentials. This is how I solved it: 

    - First of all I deleted a model repetition I had in my database (one model for the users and one model for the visitors but both models had the same fields). Sequently I paired the two forms I had with the same model. Then in my view I was finally able to iterate through all the reservations made by both registered users and visitors. Once I was able to do that I set the view to only filter the reservations through their IDs and that allowed me to let the admin being able to access all the reservations made.

- The second bug I encoutered was when I wanted to implement a maximum number of guests on the reservations in order to avoid too many bookings at the same time. This is what I did:

   - I created a method inside the model used for the bookings. This method checked the validity of the fields for the time of reservations and the number of guests. It then would query the database and filter the search to find all the bookings for a determined time of reservation. After that the method would check for the amount of guests in that specific time of reservation and if it is over a determined amount of guests the method raises an error. I then called this method in the view for the reservation before saving the reservation in the database as to report an error to the user in case their booking surpasses the limit for that specific time and date.

- The third bug revolved around the html validation of the templates. In particular the issue was in the way I displayed the buttons for the confirmation of deletion and the submission of the edited booking. Both were buttons wrapped in anchor tags and the validator swiftly reminded me that it was a semantic error on the template.

    - In order to solve them I simply deleted the anchor tags and let the django functionalities take care of the button (With some added custom CSS and Bootstrap). Once the anchor tags were removed both forms kept working smoothly as tested.

## Deployment

This section is dedicated to the steps I followed in order to successfully deploy the app on the Heroku hosting platform. In particular this deployment was executed with the shortcut present on the Heroku which allows the user to deploy directly from the GitHub repository. 

- Login to Heroku
- Create a new app
- Created a PostgreSQL database on ElephantSQL

    - Created a new instance in ElephantSQL
    - Named and defined the region for the database
    - Select a plan
    - Linked the database URL to the environment vars of the project
    - Added the database URL to the settings.py file of the django app
    - Migrated these initial changes to the database on Elephant SQL

- Link this new app the the repository for the project
- Add Database url, Secret Key and Port var to the Config Vars section on the app Settings
- Add DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1 var to Config Vars in the app settings
- Add Template Dirs and Static files variables in settings.py file
- Add the Template Dirs variable to DIRS key in TEMPLATES list in settings.py file
- Add the Heroku app name in ALLOWED HOSTS list in settings.py file
- Add the Procfile
- Git commit and push all the changes made to the repository
- Deploy manually through GitHub on the Heroku Dashboard

## Development

### Agile Method

The planning for the project has been done implementing Agile practices. In particular I have helped myself by creating some uer stories that I felt like the owner of the restaurant would have requested. In the context of the Agile methodologies some of the key processes weren't possible to implement due to the fact the the Agile team was comprised of only one individual and that the end user were not available since this is an academic project. However I was able to utilize a good variety of the concepts covered in the Agile practices module of the course. In particular I:

- Organized User Stories that would match the expectations of a potential end user.
- Gave User Stories priority utilizing custom labels. (Must have, Should have, Could have)
- Practiced assigning User Stories to the Agile Team
- Developed Acceptance Criteria for all the issues raised
- Created specific tasks for the various issues in order to organize the amount of work needed for the User Story
- Automated the linking of the User Stories to the "To Do" section of the project table.

The iterations or Sprints for this project were mainly matched with the mentor sessions. This decision was taken since there was no end user or business people involved beside me. The mentor session in this case allowed me to make the User Stories adhere to the requirements for the project, making the whole development smoother and easier to manage. 

#### Epics

The structure of the Epics for the project is fairly straightforward. My main concern was to take care of the crud functionalities first and then all the rest so the order of the epics for this project was as follows:

- Create a basic styled and functioning static website
    - Create all the templates
    - Style the templates beginning with the mobile size first
    - Connect all the urls through the views

- Create a login system
    - Use  the django allauth library to create the login, logout and signup functionalities
    - Download the templates created by the allauth library
    - Style the templates

- Create the basic CRUD functionalities
    - Implement CRUD functions for casual visitors
    - Implement CRUD functions for logged in users

- Create admin CRUD functionalities
    - Replicate the CRUD functions for the admin
    
### Flowchart, Diagrams and Wireframes

The following images are from the initial concept of the website. During the development process some changes have been made to better fit the Agile Sprints and coincide with the process outlined by the mentor. 

![This is the basic flowchart for the main logics of the project](https://res.cloudinary.com/devfabrizio/image/upload/v1691064080/Project%20Matinicus/PP4_Logic_Flowchart_jctdnc.png)

As it's clearly visible from the flowchart above the initial website flowchart has less functionalities and in general is less descriptive of the overall results I was able to obtain in the end. Part of that is easily explained by the simple fact that as I found myself researching problem solving paradigms, I consequentially inscreased my knowledge of the technologies used. I obviously proceeded to implement these new solutions and this is what cause the deviation (or addition), from the original project. The main features stayed the same, given the fact that they were required by the project goals for PP4. The other features and functionalities that were added along the process are a result of the natural research process which takes place with the development of a new project.

![This is the wireframe for the login page](https://res.cloudinary.com/devfabrizio/image/upload/v1691064399/Project%20Matinicus/signup-login.html_hi44b7.webp)

This is the wireframe for the login and signup page. From the wireframe it's noticeable what the main difference is. As I could have easily created a template with two form for login or signup operations I discovered that on most websites with these functionalities the two are always shown in different pages.  

![This is the wireframe for the main page](https://res.cloudinary.com/devfabrizio/image/upload/v1691064401/Project%20Matinicus/index.html_sxgni1.webp)

In the wireframe for the main page I deviated from the original plan mostly because, once the styling was completed I deemed the wireframe not fitting for some of the layouts I wanted to apply. In particular some of the wireframe section display a side-by-side content that could may very well be optimal for larger screen sizes by not suited for mobiles. 

![This is the wireframe for the booking page](https://res.cloudinary.com/devfabrizio/image/upload/v1691064398/Project%20Matinicus/booking.html_nipdiw.webp)

In the wireframe for the booking page (both user bookings and normal ones) the first thing I changed was the implementation of a dropdown menu for the allergies. On a business strict sense this would have been a poor choice as the number of allergies and food intollerances are way too high to be represented in a dropdown menu and made accessible to the final user. In the form I decided to apply a simple field where the user could just input a string of text with the allergy or food intollerance presented. This allows the diner to specify particular needs better than to scroll through an almost infinite number of food related issues.
