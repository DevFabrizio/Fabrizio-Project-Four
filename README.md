## User Experience
### Strategy Plane

This project involves one of the most classic type of sofware/websites in today's market, a restaurant website. In particular this website is a mock website that includes many funcionalities. The idea behind this product is to create a platform for a high-end restaurant in a somewhat remote location. In addition to that the restaurant depicted has two main features: the use of seasonal and local supply and the development and employment of local personnel. Both of these decisions have been taken to highlight the underlying issue of "restoration of the native environment". This concept is based on the idea that the local supply of seasonal produce is the key to reduce the carbon footprint due to extensive farming and the cost and emissions of the logistics chain implied in the usual restaurant setting that we're all used to. Overall the Strategy was to create a platform that would invite users and then customers to the restaurant and also give them the possibility to discover the local cuisine rivisited using modern techniques and futuristic recipes. All in a environment conscious setting.
